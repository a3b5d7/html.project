    Cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in all of our 14 countries of operation, with movement restrictions seriously impacting on health, nutrition and livelihoods.
    
    A huge issue is the reduction in access to health services with people not attending clinics due to different levels of lockdown, and out of fear of infection. This will lead to an increase in deaths from preventable and treatable conditions.
    
    The impact on health systems is having a particularly detrimental effect on women, who are being denied access to sexual and reproductive health. Also, hundreds of thousands of children under the age of one are not receiving vaccines due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Malaria season is about to begin in many countries, and there are concerns people will avoid seeking treatment out of fear of contracting Covid-19.
    
    The biggest global impact from Covid-19 is likely to be economic, with vulnerable communities facing huge hardship. Movement restrictions mean small businesses are struggling to survive. People cannot work and therefore canâ€™t afford to buy food. Informal workers, often youth, women and displaced people, are losing income but the price of food increases. This leads to malnutrition with poor people eating less.
    
    GOAL is already on the ground working hard to maintain our existing programmes while responding to and mitigating the impacts of Covid-19 at the same time. We have reached more than 17 million people to date with important hygiene education, key messaging and the provision of water stations and soaps to reduce the risk of the virus spreading and maintaining life-saving and life-sustaining programmes
    
    In the coming months, your support will be needed more than ever as the virus hits across Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
