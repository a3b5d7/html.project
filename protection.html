    Symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

    The symptoms most commonly associated with COVID-19 are:
    
        Cold-like symptoms (such as a runny nose, sneezing and/or a sore throat)
        Coughing
        Shortness of breath or pneumonia
        An elevated temperature (up to 38 degrees) 
        A fever (above 38 degrees)
        A sudden loss of smell or taste (without a blocked nose)
    
    What to do if you think you have coronavirus
    
        Stay home if you have any of the symptoms associated with COVID 19.
        Make an appointment for a coronavirus test. 
        Avoid in-person social contact. Don’t have any visitors or visit anyone else, and don’t do any shopping.
        Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, if you have a fever above 38 degrees or if you have trouble breathing.
